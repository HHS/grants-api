# Typography

## Overview

Typography is one of the most, if not the most, important communication tools for our brand. It carries our brand voice; with it, we establish our tone, personality, and message.&#x20;

## Primary Typeface

### Public Sans

Public Sans is a strong, neutral, open-source typeface for interfaces, text, and headings developed by USWDS. It is seen across US government websites and communications, giving Grants an additional source of credibility.

[Download Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans). It is already included in USWDS but should be added to HHS staff computers to maintain brand alignment.

## Secondary Typeface

### Newsreader

Newsreader is an open-source font from Production Type designed for on-screen, longer-form reading. NewsReader’s shapes are open and familiar, fostering engaged reading, with features like optical sizes and large display cuts that maximize the type’s ability to be expressive.&#x20;

## Hierarchy

Different type sizes should always have a relationship to one another. There is no exact rule, but select a base type size in a composition and make all other sizes proportionate to this foundation—our brand defaults to a 1.35 type scale.
