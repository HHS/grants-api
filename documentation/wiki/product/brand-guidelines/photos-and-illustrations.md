# Photos & Illustrations

## Overview

The impact of Grants.gov's purposeful investments comes alive in our compelling photo library.

Each image paints a vivid picture of how Grants.gov successfully empowers individuals and organizations worldwide and delivers real-world results. The photos highlight the multifaceted nature of the grants ecosystem – from students pursuing innovative research to community initiatives tackling the lack of clean water to organizations improving outcomes for seniors.

## Color & Photography

When choosing a photo, look for things in the image that closely match a color in our palette. This will be the most harmonious way of situating a photo in our brand identity. Make sure there’s enough contrast between the image and background color.

## Examples

Photography supports our communication needs in composition by pairing a clear and dynamic visual with text or other content. Align photos to the grid to maintain relationships with the surrounding elements. Below are some examples of photography in use.
