# Logo

## Overview

The logo is our primary identifier. It contains both the star symbol and our name in the wordmark. It should be used most often to represent our brand, positioning Grants.gov as a trusted and innovative organization dedicated to increasing access to grants and improving the grants experience for everyone.

The logo is used most often as it captures more of our brand characters. The symbol and wordmark are next frequently used, while the favicon is reserved only for specific digital applications.

The symbol and wordmark have been carefully scaled, spaced, and aligned to create the logo. Do not alter its construction.

## Star Symbol

The logo features a unique five-pointed star composed of double lines. The star, a timeless symbol of trust and guidance, speaks directly to Grants.govâ€™s purpose and focus as a federal organization. Each double line is a pathway radiating out from the central star, symbolizing openness, accessibility, and helping others achieve their goals.

## Wordmark

The wordmark features our name only. Use it in supportive applications, especially when the audience is already very familiar with our brand and identity.

## Favicon

The favicon uses our star symbol in a circle container shape to help with legibility in small or complex environments. Only use it when necessary; never pair it with the wordmark or logo.
