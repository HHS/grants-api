## Overview

### Summary

* **What:** Identify representatives of underserved communities and establish a group to engage them in defining and advising the direction of work for the Simpler Grants.gov initiative
* **Why:** Ensures that Simpler.Grants.gov HHS decision makers design with the most underserved communities in the grants ecosystem and create continuous feedback loops to ensure equitable product development. This includes framing strategic problems, roadmap development, designing solutions, and iteration.
* **Who**
  * The most underserved applicant individuals and groups within the grants ecosystem
  * Internal Simpler.Grants.gov stakeholders

### Business value

#### Problem

* The current grant making system privileges certain groups above others according to access to power and resources, making grants distribution highly inaccessible to specific groups.&#x20;
* The most underserved communities have not been involved in setting priorities, strategy, and roadmap for grants.gov, a project that has a north star of minimizing the burden borne by the most underserved.&#x20;
* Underserved communities have not been able to lead any part of these initiatives or determine where investments ought to be made for their benefit or influence the grants.gov product roadmap.
* There is no standard research protocols and processes for obtaining participant consent that proactively mitigate potential harm to vulnerable participants

#### Value

* By working with underserved communities to directly involve them in project design, Simpler.Grants.gov decision makers increase the likelihood of identifying and solving the most burdensome problems and increasing grants access for Novices (a primary archetype [identified through previous research](https://simpler.grants.gov/research)).&#x20;
* The Co-Design Group will be an equitable foundation upon which simpler.grants.gov is built, shifting the power structure of typical product development cycles to a community-led model of strategic engagement and partnership that includes radical participatory design.
* Building relationships with these communities will allow internal stakeholders to identify and uplift existing community designed solutions with Simpler.Grants.gov work, thereby removing the risk of duplication of effort and increasing the chance of user adoption.&#x20;
* Giving opportunity to the most underserved to lead in a substantive way promises powerful transformative potential to achieve healing and lasting social justice outcomes within the civic sector. It will encourage civic actors to reframe ways of thinking, speaking, and ultimately interacting with underserved populations-moving from negative 'problem' based perceptions to positive 'asset' based perceptions
* The Co-Design Group is rooted in [Design Justice Principles](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles), which centers the experiences of underserved end users throughout the entire framing, execution, and evaluation of project planning and delivery. This acknowledges and extends the reach of already existing community designed solutions.&#x20;
* By improving the experience and access for the most underserved communities, we improve the experience and access for everyone who uses the service.
* The Co-Design Group will enable Simpler.Grants.gov internal stakeholders to more effectively implement best practices in user research by identifying opportunities for research ahead of time, mitigating risk, and more quickly standing up generative and evaluative studies with a pre-screened target user panel.&#x20;
* The Co-Design Group will develop research protocols and obtain participant consent to ensure that participants are protected from harm that might arise from government stakeholders obtaining potentially sensitive data.

#### Goals

This effort allows us to…

* Bring the most impacted applicants into partnership with grants.gov internal stakeholders to frame, plan, design, and solution grants experience
* Create continuous feedback loop between community groups already working on behalf of marginalized community and allows grants.gov internal stakeholders to contribute to their existing solutions and build with (not for)
* Increase speed of participant recruitment for studies that aim to gather insights center user needs and behaviors throughout the product development lifecycle
* Improve strategy and proactive planning for future grants.gov work by inviting co-design group participants to frame problems and contribute insights that will guide roadmap development based on the real challenges users navigate in their lives

#### Non-goals

* Cross-pollinating the Co-Design Group with other deliverables, such as the [collaborative-code-challenge.md](collaborative-code-challenge.md "mention")

#### Assumptions and dependencies

* The budget for compensation needs to be approved by HHS and ready for dispersement to participants.
* Tremendous needs to be procured so that we can disperse payment to participants

### User stories

* As a **HHS staff member**, I want to:
  * center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcome of the design process so that I can ensure that our solutions lead to sustainable positive outcomes
* As a **Co-Design Group administrator and project maintainer**, I want:
  * a streamlined process for collaborating with Co-Design Group members so that I can ensure that there is continuous feedback loop throughout strategic planning and product development
  * to ensure that the Co-Design Group includes representatives from a range of communities facing limited access so that they can reflect diverse voices and perspectives of those impacted by the outcomes
  * a longer-term view and tactical plan for how we will leverage the Co-Design Group so I can build trust with the group, set expectations, and right-size capacity needed to run the group for a defined duration of time
  * a manageable size of participants that matches the need of the project and capacity of the development team
  * ensure that participants understand how their data will be used, obtain their consent, and that I have a way of protecting and anonymizing their data
* As a **grantor**, I want:
  * Simpler.Grants.gov to be simple, effective, and accessible and work for all communities and individuals in the grants ecosystem so that it’s easier to attract a wide range of candidates
  * the communities I'm trying to reach to be involved in the problem defining phases, so that I can make sure my grants are accessible to those communities
* As an **applicant and a member of the general public**, I want:
  * Simpler Grants.gov to incorporate feedback from underserved communities, so that it's easier and more accessible for everyone to find and apply for grants

## Definition of done

Following sections describe the conditions that must be met to consider this deliverable "done".

#### **Must have**

* [ ] General requirements
  * [ ] All new services have completed a 508 compliance review (if necessary)
  * [ ] Data needed for metrics is actively being captured in PROD
  * [ ] Key architectural decisions made about this deliverable are documented publicly (if relevant)
* [ ] HHS approval of the compensation budget received
* [ ] A panel of 12-24 participants have been selected, and these participants:
  * [ ] Represent underserved communities that have been determined to have unequal access to grants
  * [ ] Have completed the screening and consent process
  * [ ] Have been onboarded to our open source tools that are relevant for the Co-Design Group&#x20;

* [ ] A translator is present for all sessions with the Co-Design Group, when necessary
