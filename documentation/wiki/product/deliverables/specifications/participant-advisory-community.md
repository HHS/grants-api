## Overview

### Summary

* **What:** Define scope, target underserved communities, and invite representative individuals necessary to build a Participant Advisory Community around the Simpler.Grants.gov initiative
* **Why:** Ensures that Simpler.Grants.gov HHS decision makers design with the most underserved communities in the grants ecosystem and create continuous feedback loops to ensure equitable product development. This includes framing strategic problems, roadmap development, designing solutions, and iteration.
* **Who**
  * The most underserved applicant individuals/groups within the grants ecosystem
  * Internal Simpler.Grants.gov stakeholders

**Out of scope**

* Defined plans for individual PAC activities
* This effort will not include more than one PAC engagement schedule beyond applicants (e.g. for grantors or system partners)
* We will have other forms of user research for more diverse user communities that will be handled outside of this 30k deliverable

### Business value

#### Problem

Firstly, the current grant making system privileges certain groups above others according to access to power and resources, making grants distribution highly inaccessible to specific groups. Secondly, the most impacted underserved communities have not been concretely identified or involved in the Simpler.Grants.gov project, which inhibits Simpler.Grants.gov stakeholders from framing and solving specific contextual problems faced by these underserved communities in tandem with product build. Thirdly, there are no research protocols or process for obtaining participant consent that proactively mitigates potential participant harm. Finally, the product roadmap has not been designed to integrate opportunities for executing and implementing insights from user research, which would mitigate risks in user adoption and usage.

#### Value

By identifying and directly involving representatives of the Novice archetype, [identified through previous research](https://simpler.grants.gov/research), along with other underserved communities in project design, Simpler.Grants.gov HHS decision makers increase the likelihood of identifying and solving the right problems, those that will increase grants access to underserved communities. Moreover, building relationships with these communities will allow internal stakeholders to identify and uplift existing community designed solutions with Simpler.Grants.gov work, thereby removing the risk of duplication of effort and increasing the chance of user adoption. To this end, value is rooted in [Design Justice Principles](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles), which centers the experiences of underserved end users throughout the entire framing, execution, and evaluation of project planning and delivery and acknowledges and extends the reach of already existing community designed solutions. By improving the experience and access for the most underserved communities, we improve the experience and access for everyone who uses the service.

Once created, the PAC will enable Simpler.Grants.gov internal stakeholders to more effectively implement best practices in user research by identifying opportunities for research ahead of time, mitigating risk, and more quickly standing up generative and evaluative studies with a pre-screened target user panel. The PAC will develop research protocols and obtain participant consent to ensure that participants are protected from harm that might arise from government stakeholders obtaining potentially sensitive data. &#x20;

#### Goals

This effort allows us to…&#x20;

* Bring the most impacted applicants into partnership with grants.gov internal stakeholders to frame, plan, design, and solution grants experience
* Create continuous feedback loop between community groups already working on behalf of marginalized community and allows grants.gov internal stakeholders to contribute to their existing solutions and build with (not for)
* Increase speed of participant recruitment for studies that aim to gather insights center user needs and behaviors throughout the product development lifecycle
* Improve strategy and proactive planning for future grants.gov work by inviting PAC participants to frame problems and contribute insights that will guide roadmap development based on the real challenges users navigate in their lives



### User stories

* As a **HHS staff member**, I want to:
  * center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcome of the design process so that I can ensure that our solutions lead to sustainable positive outcomes&#x20;
* As a **PAC administrator and project maintainer**, I want:&#x20;
  * a streamlined process for collaborating with PAC members so that I can ensure that there is continuous feedback loop throughout strategic planning and product development
  * to ensure that the PAC includes representatives from a range of communities facing limited access so that they can reflect diverse voices and perspectives of those impacted by the outcomes
  * a longer-term view and tactical plan for how we will leverage the PAC so I can build trust with the group, set expectations, and right-size capacity needed to run the group for a defined duration of time
  * a manageable size of participants that matches the need of the project and capacity of the team
  * ensure that participants understand how their data will be used, obtain their consent, and that I have a way of protecting and anonymizing their data
* As a **grantor**, I want:&#x20;
  * Simpler Grants.gov to be simple, effective, and accessible and work for all communities and individuals in the grants ecosystem so that it’s easier to attract a wide range of candidates &#x20;
* As an **applicant and a member of the general public**, I want:&#x20;
  * Simpler Grants.gov to be simple, effective, and accessible and work for all communities and individuals in the grants ecosystem so that it’s easier to find and apply for grants

## Technical description

### Planning and scope definition

**Goal**

Define the scope and purpose of the PAC, identify underserved communities, and establish the framework for engagement.

* Define PAC scope and purpose
* Identify and prioritize underserved communities through quantitative and qualitative data analysis&#x20;
* Determine budget and compensation strategy for PAC participants
* Develop a recruitment strategy to reach underserved communities

The criteria that should inform this approach include:

* How will we compensate PAC participants so that it is worth their time?&#x20;
* How will we recruit members of the public to ensure that we're reaching underserved communities and there are equal opportunities for people to join?&#x20;
* Will the PAC be invite only or will we put out a call for applications more broadly?



### PAC guidelines and roadmap planning

**Goal**

Set clear objectives for the PAC and integrate their input into the project roadmap.

* Define opportunities in the product roadmap where the PAC will be leveraged
* Set guidelines, expectations, and screening processes for PAC candidates
* Establish a central location for PAC participants on the public wiki or accessible location where participants can find materials, upcoming events, agreements, etc.
* Achieve alignment on involvement expectations and responsibilities with PAC participants

The criteria that should inform this approach include:

* How will we ensure that our roadmap is informed by the PAC and user research?
* How can we set clear expectations with the PAC candidates?&#x20;

* [Open source onboarding process](open-source-onboarding.md) that will be used to onboard members of the PAC to our communication tools once they are selected
* Method/platform for holding and protecting participant PII, Ethn.io, will need to be procured
* Allocated budget for compensating participants and funding any onsite activities/events

Is there any notable functionality we do _**not**_ expect to be in place before works starts on this deliverable?

* Translations

### Not in scope

List of functionality or features that are explicitly out of scope for this deliverable.

* Defined plans for individual PAC activities
* This effort will not include more than one PAC engagement schedule beyond applicants

### Open questions

<details>

<summary>What are the PRA requirements?</summary>

We can fast track specific approvals under the overall existing generic clearance. Fast tracks usually take 3-5 days. Felix Lorenzo at HHS owns this process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will we provide translations for people for whom English is not their first language?</summary>

It is likely that people whose first language is not English are more disadvantaged than other communities. We may be limited in our ability to provide real-time translations in this initial initiative, but we should plan how we can engage those communities. We should be able to provide text materials in other languages but real-time translations may be difficult.&#x20;

We could potentially focus on a demographic segment where users who are fluent in English but not their first language attend sessions that help us get some input into this underserved population

<details>

<summary>Would we need a 508-compliance review of any materials (PDFs, slide decks, etc.) we're preparing for the PAC?</summary>

To be answered

## Integrations

### Translations

Does this deliverable involve delivering any content that needs translation?

* TBD

If so, when will English-language content be locked? Then when will translation be started and completed?

* n/a

### Services going into PROD for the first time

This can include services going into PROD behind a feature flag that is not turned on.

* Ethn.io, which will be the tool used for recruitment

### Services being integrated in PROD for the first time

Are there multiple services that are being connected for the first time in PROD?

* Ethn.io, which will be the tool used for recruitment
