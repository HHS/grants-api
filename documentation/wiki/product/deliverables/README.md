# Deliverables

## Latest reporting

Since September 2024, we've been tracking our deliverables in a [GitHub-based product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/HHS/projects/12). Please refer to that roadmap to view the deliverables we've planned or worked on since September.

## Previous deliverables

Prior to adopting the current process for tracking deliverables in GitHub, we used the following pages in our wiki to scope and report on deliverables.

* [Static site soft launch](static-site-soft-launch.md)
* [Static site public launch](static-site-public-launch.md)
* [GET opportunities endpoint](get-opportunities.md)
* [Open source onboarding](open-source-onboarding.md)
* [Co-design group planning](co-design-group.md)
