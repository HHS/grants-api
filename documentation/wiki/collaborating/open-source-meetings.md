# Open Source Meetings

This page outlines our open source community Zoom meeting schedule, ensuring all contributors and members of our open-source project have clear expectations and guidelines for interaction, collaboration, and communication. Our aim is to foster an inclusive, respectful, and vibrant community.

## Community Meetings

### Monthly Zoom Meetings

* **Purpose**: To discuss project updates, upcoming features, and community proposals.
* **Attendance**: Anyone interested in open source development on Simpler Grants should attend!
* **Cadence**: These meetings are held once a month. The exact date and time will be announced two weeks in advance on our project's main communication channel (e.g., GitHub, Discord, or mailing list).

### Biweekly Office Hours

* **Purpose**: To provide a more informal setting where community members can ask questions, seek guidance on contributions, or discuss potential features with the core team.
* **Attendance**: Similar to the monthly meetings, anyone interested in open source development on Simpler Grants should attend.
* **Cadence**: Office hours are held every other week. The schedule will be posted on our project's website and main communication channel.

## Proposing New Meetings or Engagement Activities

We welcome suggestions for new types of community engagement activities or meetings. To propose a new idea, please follow these steps:

2. **Community Feedback**: Allow at least two weeks for community feedback and discussion on your proposal.
3. **Review and Approval**: The core team will review the proposal and community feedback, making a decision based on the alignment with project goals and available resources.
