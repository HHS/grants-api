# Reporting & Removing Content

When content that is in violation of our policies is shared in the Simpler Grants communication channels, follow the steps below to remove that content from the platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Many of the steps to remove content involve contacting platform administrators.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Slack

### If it was a message that _you_ posted:

1. Select the `More options` menu (the three vertically stacked dots that appear when you hover over your post)
2. Choose either `Edit message` or `Delete message` to remove the content

### If it was a message that _someone else_ posted:

1. Contact a slack admin
2. The slack admin will follow the steps above to delete the post from that channel

## GitHub

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Only _administrators_ can remove sensitive content from GitHub because content added to GitHub will remain visible in the history of the codebase until an administrator scrubs it from the repository.
{% endhint %}

1. Contact a GitHub administrator who is a software engineer
2. They will scrub the content from the history of the code repository

## Google Groups

### If it was a message that _you_ posted:

1. Select the `More options` menu (the three vertically stacked dots that appear when you hover over your post)
2. Choose either `Edit` or `Delete` to remove the content

### If it was a message that _someone else_ posted:

* Select the `More` menu (the three vertically stacked dots that appear when you hover over your post)
