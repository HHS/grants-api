## Content Privacy

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Content that you share in the channels listed above is **never** fully private. Administrators can view all of the content shared in each channel, and the content in these channels are subject to [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html).
{% endhint %}

There are a few important considerations regarding the privacy of content that is shared in any of the channels listed above:

* **Admins can view all messages:** Administrators of each channel have access to view and delete or modify content shared within that channel. This includes channels that have the semblance of privacy, such as direct messages within Slack.
* **Content is subject to FOIA:** All of the content shared in these channels is also subject to a [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html). That may include content that has been categorized as "internal", pending FOIA request approval. This further underscores the importance of **never** sharing sensitive or prohibited information in any of these changes.&#x20;

## Reporting & Removing Content

If content that is in violation of our above policies is posted in any of our communications channels please follow the steps below to remove the content. If you are the one who posted it by accident please remove it if possible. If someone else has posted it or you are in a channel that you do not have privileges to delete it, please contact the appropriate Simpler Grants administrator to have it removed.&#x20;
