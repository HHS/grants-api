# Documentation for the Simpler Grants Project

This folder contains documentation for the Simpler Grants Project.

## Goals

Our vision is for the following to become true:

**_Grants.gov is the simplest, most inclusive, and most gratifying way to find and apply for financial assistance ever built, inside or outside the federal government. Grants.gov helps ensure that no communities are underserved by the federal government_**.

See [goals.md](./goals.md) for more information about the vision and goals for the project.
