# Communications Tooling: Wiki Platform

- **Status:** Draft
- **Last Modified:** 2023-06-15 <!-- REQUIRED -->
- **Related Issue:** [#{issue number}](https://github.com/HHS/grants-api/issues) <!-- RECOMMENDED -->
- **Deciders:** {list everyone involved in the decision} <!-- OPTIONAL -->
- **Tags:** {space and/or comma separated list of tags} <!-- OPTIONAL -->

## Context and Problem Statement

The [communications platform milestone](milestone) identifies a series of platforms through which the Grants API project needs to engage both internal and external stakeholders. One of these platforms is a wiki for storing notes, documents, and other content about the project. Ideally we would select a platform that balances ease of use and flexibility with the cost of implementing and maintaining the wiki.

The goal of this ADR is to evaluate a series of potential wiki platforms and determine which one best fits the needs and objectives of this project based on the decision criteria outlined below.

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

#### Must Have

- **Usability:** Non-technical users should be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.
- **Public Access:** Members of the public should be able to read public documentation in the wiki without needing to sign up or login to a service.
- **Content Review:** Collaborators should be able to review and edit draft content before those changes are published.
- **Version History:** Editors should be able to see and restore previous versions of a given page.
- **Multi-Media:** The platform should support multiple types of media (e.g. videos, images, file uploads, tables, diagrams) with minimal configuration.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The platform should provide support for displaying content in multiple languages.
- **Web Analytics:** The platform should provide support for tracking site usage and other web analytics.
- **Onboarding Costs:** Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).
- **Maintenance Costs:** It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the wiki, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).
- **Authority to Operate (ATO):** The platform already must be authorized under the Grants.gov ATO (Authority to Operate) or ATO coverage must be requested.

#### Nice to Have

- **External Contributions:** Members of the public should be able to suggest changes to wiki content and internal stakeholders should be able to review those contributions before they are published.
- **Data Access:** Content generated and stored in the wiki should be accessible outside of the wiki platform, either through syncing content to an HHS owned repository or through an official API.
- **Machine Readability:** The wiki platform should also support storing and exposing content in a machine-readable format so that certain types structured data can be managed within and accessed from the wiki without parsing.
- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage and host the wiki content should be open source, if possible.

## Options Considered

- [Confluence](confluence)
- [Notion](notion)
- [GitHub Wiki](gh-wiki)
- [GitBook](gitbook)
- [WikiJS](wiki-js)
- Git-based Headless CMS (e.g. [Decap CMS](git-cms-decap) and [Tina.io](git-cms-tina))
- API-based Headless CMS (e.g. [Strapi](strapi) and [Directus](directus))

## Decision Outcome <!-- REQUIRED -->

Chosen option: "{option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which satisfies x condition | ... }.

### Positive Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- {e.g., improved performance on quality metric, new capability enabled, ...}
- ...

### Negative Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- {e.g., decreased performance on quality metric, risk, follow-up decisions required, ...}
- ...

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- OPTIONAL -->

### Confluence

[Confluence](confluence) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) documentation and collaboration tool offered by Atlassian that organizes content into "spaces" and offers a series of templates and components that can be used to create custom documentation for internal and external stakeholders.

#### Details

- **Hosting:** SaaS
- **Pricing:** [$5.75 (standard) or $11 (premium) per user per month](confluence-pricing)
- **Public Access:** Supported, but limited to individual pages or entire spaces
- **Content Review:** Supported through drafts, not enforceable
- **Supported Media:** TODO
- **I18n:** Limited third party plugins for automating translation
- **Web Analytics:** [Google Analytics plugin](confluence-ga) available, also native analytics with premium tier
- **Open Source Status:** Propietary
- **External Contributions:** Only supported in public spaces (without review)

#### Pros

- Relatively user friendly for non-technical users
- Supports a wide variety of media and page content
- Supports drafts, which allow edits to be made without publishing
- Supports page history and comparison of previous versions
- Limited support for public pages and spaces
- Minimimal ongoing maintenance costs due to SaaS hosting
- Most affordable per user cost for a given tier of features

#### Cons

- Does not support a formal review process for drafts before they can be published
- Supports fewer content types than Notion, especially in terms of structured data
- Content can only be made public at the level of an individual page or an entire space
- Content API is limited in capability and less intuitive than Notion API
- No direct support for internationalization and localization
- Closed source proprietary tool
- Data is controlled by Confluence, only accessible via API

### Notion

[Notion](notion) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) documentation and collaboration tool that also allows users to add structured and semi-structured content to pages. Because Notion offers a fully-featured API for reading and managing content, it also has a robust set of community integrations that extend Notion's core functionality.

#### Details

- **Hosting:** SaaS
- **Pricing:** [$8 (pro) or $15(business) per user per month](notion-pricing)
- **Public Access:** Supported, but oriented around individual pages
- **Content Review:** Not supported

- No content review process, all changes and comments are published automatically
- No direct support for internationalization and localization
- Page history is limited to 30 (pro) or 90 (business) days
