## Context and Problem Statement

The [communications platform milestone](milestone) identifies a series of platforms through which the Grants API project needs to engage both internal and external stakeholders. One of these platforms is an analytics platform for tracking key metrics during the launch of the first version of beta.grants.gov and as the project continues to grow. We will evaluate top 3-5 analytics tools, including analytics.gov and Google Analytics, to identify the best fit for our specific needs and objectives. The selected tool should provide valuable insights and data to help us measure and optimize the platform's performance.

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

#### Must Have

- **Data tracking capabilities**: solution should be able to track the essential metrics and events relevant to the project's goals, such as page views, user interactions, and other custom events.
- **Data visualization and reporting**: The tool should offer clear and comprehensive data visualization and reporting features to present data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret for multiple audiences (public, internal HHS, etc.)
- **Integration with existing systems**: consider whether the analytics tool can seamlessly integrate with the project's existing infrastructure, and other tools used in the development process. We will have a content management system in the future and we should have forward thinking to ensure it could be compatible with various CMS options. 
- **Real-time data processing**: Assess whether the analytics tool can provide real-time data processing capabilities, enabling timely responses to critical events.
- **Data privacy and security**: Ensure that the selected tool complies with data privacy regulations and provides robust security measures to protect sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Consider whether the analytics tool can handle the expected growth in data volume and user traffic as the project expands.
- **Cost**: Evaluate the pricing structure of the analytics tool.
- **Customization and flexibility**: Determine the level of customization and flexibility offered by the tool to tailor it to the specific needs and requirements of the project.
- **Support and documentation**: Check the availability of technical support, documentation, and community forums to aid in implementation and troubleshooting.
- **User-friendly interface**: Consider the ease of use and intuitiveness of the tool's interface, enabling team members to efficiently navigate and extract insights.

#### Nice to Have

- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage and host the analytics should be open source, if possible.

## Options Considered

- [Analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/)
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision)
- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
- [Adobe Analytics](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html)
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)


## Decision Outcome <!-- REQUIRED -->



### Positive Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: With an analytics platform, our project can gather valuable data and insights about usage and identify where there are shortfalls to our product. It can allow us to ensure we are building an equitable solution for the public. This data-driven approach enables informed decision-making and allows teams to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.  
- **Improved Performance**: Analytics platforms help track key performance indicators (KPIs) and measure the success of various initiatives and milestones. By monitoring these metrics, we can optimize our strategies and improve overall performance.  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Understanding user behavior through analytics helps tailor products, services, and content to meet users' needs and preferences leading to a better user experience.

### Negative Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Collecting and analyzing user data can raise privacy concerns, especially with the increasing focus on data protection. We must handle data responsibly and set a high standard for compliance.
- **Data Overload**: Too much data without proper analysis can overwhelm teams and lead to decision paralysis. It's important to focus on relevant metrics and insights to continue moving forward.
- **Misinterpretation of Data**: Misinterpreting or misrepresenting data can lead to incorrect conclusions and misguided strategies. Proper data analysis and understanding are essential to draw accurate insights.
- **Cost and Resource Allocation**: Implementing and maintaining an analytics platform can be costly and resource-intensive that goes beyond just the cost of the tool.
- **Learning Curve**: Adopting new analytics platforms may require training and time for team members to become proficient, potentially affecting productivity during the initial stages.
