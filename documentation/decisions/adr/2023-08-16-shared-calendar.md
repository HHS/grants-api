# ADR - Shared Calendar 

Context and Problem Statement

We want to explore and evaluate options for a grants.gov shared calendar in order to facilitate cross team meetings. This shared calendar tool will be utilized by both internal individuals at HHS, Agile6 and Nava, requiring the shared calendar platform to be covered under the Grants.gov Authority to Operate (ATO). Users on the HHS network should have access to view this shared calendar. The selected platform should have the ability to create and share calendar events that are only visible to the grants.gov team. Additionally, Users should be able to create and share calendar events that are visible to members of the public. Lastly, Users should have the ability to add the details for a video conference to a calendar invite, and preferably create a new meeting-specific video conference link directly from the event creation page.

Decision Drivers

Functionality: consider the features and functionalities offered with each platform. Consider whether the shared calendar solution provides essential capabilities like ability to create public and private meeting invites, accessibility to the HHS grants.gov team, video conferencing integration 
Usability: the selected shared calendar solution should be user-friendly and intuitive. It should be easy for team members, including both technical and non-technical individuals, to navigate and utilize effectively.
Accessibility: solution should be accessible for all individuals, including but not limited to individuals with visual, hearing or motor impairments.
Public Access: the selected solution should have the ability to be accessible by public members outside the core grants.gov team
Cost: evaluate the pricing structure, considering growth of users and additional features in the future
Open-source: a solution that offers open-source is more likely to align with HHS values and provide transparency, customizability, community collaboration, longevity and continuity, cost effectiveness, and overall autonomy for our project.
