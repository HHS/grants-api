## Context and Problem Statement

An email marketing tool is primarily used for creating, sending, and tracking email campaigns to a list of subscribers. It allows for us to engage with our audience, push notifications and newsletters to our users, share information, and build customer relationships through email. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

#### Must Have

- **Usability:** Non-technical users should be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.
- **Content Review:** Collaborators should be able to review and edit draft content before emails are sent out.
- **Comments:** Reviewers should be able to leave in-line comments on content that they are reviewing.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The solution should provide support for displaying content in multiple languages.
- **Analytics:** The platform should provide support for tracking open rates, click-through-rate and other other web analytics.
- **Onboarding Costs:** Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).
- **Maintenance Costs:** It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the email marketing tool, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).
- **Authority to Operate (ATO):** The tool should be FedRAMPed or have an Authority to Operate as it will have names and email addresses of public users. 

#### Nice to Have

- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage the email marketing content should be open source, if possible.
- **Community & Support**: The platform has a strong community for ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes
- **Scalability**: The platform should be able to hadndle a growing number of subscribers without performance issues

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- OPTIONAL -->

### Sendy



#### Details



#### Pros

- Sendy is currently used by HHS and it would be simple for existing users to start using the tool right away
- It provides great metrics and analytics
- HHS is able to send a few campaigns simultaneously
- Sendy is self-hosted which means we have control over the email list and the data. Sendy is a self hosted application that runs on our own web server. Pay once and it's yours, there's no recurring fee.

#### Cons

- Campaigns with larged audiences or number of emails take a long time to send and a user cannot use the tool while an email is being sent. Currently, we have 1M subscribers and it takes a long time to send to that many subscribers
