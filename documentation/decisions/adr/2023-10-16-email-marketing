## Context and Problem Statement


## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

#### Must Have

- **Usability:** Non-technical users should be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.
- **Content Review:** Collaborators should be able to review and edit draft content before emails are sent out.
- **Comments:** Reviewers should be able to leave in-line comments on content that they are reviewing.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The solution should provide support for displaying content in multiple languages.
- **Analytics:** The platform should provide support for tracking open rates, click-through-rate and other other web analytics.
- **Onboarding Costs:** Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).
- **Maintenance Costs:** It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the email marketing tool, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).
- **Authority to Operate (ATO):** The tool should be FedRAMPed or have an Authority to Operate as it will have names and email addresses of public users. 

#### Nice to Have

- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage the email marketing content should be open source, if possible.
