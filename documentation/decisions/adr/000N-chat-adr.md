# ADR: Chat

- **Status:** Proposed <!-- REQUIRED -->
- **Last Modified:** 2023-07-05 <!-- REQUIRED -->
- **Related Issue:** #105 (https://github.com/HHS/grants-equity/issues/105) <!-- RECOMMENDED -->
- **Deciders:** {list everyone involved in the decision} <!-- REQUIRED -->
- **Tags:** docs:adr topic:comms <!-- OPTIONAL -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to explore and evaluate options for group chat in order to facilitate effective cross-team and communication. This chat tool will be utilized by both internal individuals at HHS and the general public, requiring usability and effectiveness across diverse user needs. Additionally, the selected tool should have the capacity to scale and adapt as the project expands. There is currently a lack of a transparent chat tool that meets our requirements. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

**Functionality:** consider the features and functionalities offered with each chat tool. Consider whether the chat solution provides essential capabilities like direct messaging, public channels for messaging, public and private channels, replying to messages in threads that other users can see, emojis to react to message, file sharing, search functionality, integrations.  
**Usability:** chat solution should be user-friendly and intuitive. IT should be easy for team members, including both technical and non-technical individuals, to navigate and utilize effectively.  
**Scalability:** solution should be able to accommodate the projected growth in the number of users, conversations, and data as the project expands. Ensure that the tool can handle demand without compromising performance  
**Integration capabilities:** solution is able to integrate with other tools and platforms that the project relies on. Integration with project management tools, issue trackers, wiki, document sharing, sprint retro.  
**Accessibility:** solution should be accessible for all individuals, including but not limited to individuals with visual, hearing or motor impairments. A chat solution should support keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast options, and support assistive technologies.  
**Community and support:** consider the size and activity of the user community. An active community, similarly to an FOSS community, can provide valuable support, resources, and community-developed plugins or integrations.  
**Cost:** evaluate the pricing structure, considering growth of users and additional features in the future.  
**Self-hosting vs. cloud-based:** evaluate whether the solutions are self-hosted where we have complete control over data and infrastructure or cloud-based that handles hosting and maintenance.  
**Open-source:** a solution that offers open-source is more likely to align with HHS values and provide transparency, customizability, community collaboration, longevity and continuity, cost effectiveness, and overall autonomy for our project.

## Cost to add public users

To understand the cost as we grow and expand chat to become accessible to public users, we want to evaluate costs for our top chat options: Slack and Rocket.chat

**Slack:**¬†

- Guest Roles (External users that are not part of a paid workspace). Host pays for the guest roles for mult-channel use. Single channel based off number of members on host workspace.¬†

- Slack Connect (requires both your workspace and their workspace be on a paid plan or start a trial). There is no additional charge on either workspace. Slack Connect (More for users that already have their own paid workspace). These users can have multi-channel access at no additional charge.¬†

- Guest users (Allows for the host workspace to invite users under the host plan)

  - Single Channel guests would be no charge and multi-channel guests would be billed like regular members of your workspace.
  - Single-Channel Guests are free and can only access one channel. For every paid active member in your workspace, you can add up to 5 guests. For example, if you have 10 members, you can invite up to 50 Single-Channel Guests.
  - Multi Channel guests would be billed like a regular member of your workspace.
