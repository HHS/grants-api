# Goals

The following are currently very draft and not finalized goals for the grants.gov modernization effort. Expect these to undergo substantial revision as we continue to refine our goals.

## Vision

Our vision is for the following to become true:

We want Grants.gov to be an extremely simple, accessible, and easy-to-use tool for posting, finding, sharing, and applying for federal financial assistance. Our mission is to increase access to grants and improve the grants experience for everyone.

## Mission

To support you as a grants.gov user and stakeholder, we on the grants.gov team make a commitment to the following:

### Make grants.gov easy
* Make it as easy as possible for federal grantors to post opportunity listings to grants.gov
* Provide a one-stop shop for all federal discretionary opportunities, and make it as easy as possible for potential applicants to discover opportunities relevant to their needs
* Make it as easy as possible for applicants to apply for opportunities, through all aspects of the application including forms and attachments
* Provide frictionless functionality and help users when they get stuck

### Make grants.gov accessible & collaborative
* Ensure that all communities have access to the grantmaking process
* Ensure that communities with limited financial resources are better able to discover and apply for the opportunities for which they're qualified
* Connect federal opportunities to more eligible applicants from all communities
* Promote collaboration and build trust between the federal government and the public

### Make grants.gov transparent & participatory
* Make every step of the grants cycle transparent to understand and track
* Provide the public with all available data about the grantmaking process, except data that can't be shared due to privacy or security concerns
* Provide a transparent roadmap of what we're currently and planning to work on and why, and solicit, engage with, and act on stakeholder feedback on that roadmap
* Work in the open, with fully open-source code[^1]

## Metrics

The following metrics serve as key performance indicators of whether we're achieving our mission as described above.
