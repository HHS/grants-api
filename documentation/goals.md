# Goals

The following are currently very draft and not finalized goals for the grants.gov modernization effort. Expect these to undergo substantial revision as we continue to refine our goals.

## Vision

Our vision is for the following to become true:

Grants.gov is the simplest, most inclusive, and most satisfying way to find and apply for financial assistance ever built, inside or outside the federal government.

Grants.gov helps ensure that no communities are underserved by the federal government.

## Mission

To support you as a grants.gov user and stakeholder, we on the grants.gov team make a commitment to the following:

### Make grants.gov easy
* Make it as easy as possible for federal grantors to post opportunity listings to grants.gov
* Provide a one-stop shop for all federal discretionary opportunities, and make it as easy as possible for potential applicants to discover opportunities relevant to their needs
* Make it as easy as possible for applicants to apply for opportunities
* Provide frictionless functionality and help users when they get stuck

### Make grants.gov inclusive & collaborative
* Ensure that all communities are equitably served by the grantmaking process
* Ensure that communities with limited financial resources are better able to discover and apply for the opportunities for which they're qualified
* Connect federal opportunities to more eligible applicants from underserved and overburdened communities
* Promote collaboration and build trust between the federal government and the public

### Make grants.gov transparent & participatory
* Make every step of the grants cycle transparent to understand and track
* Provide the public with all available data about the grantmaking process, except data that can't be shared due to privacy or security concerns
* Provide a transparent roadmap of what we're currently and planning to work on and why, and solicit, engage with, and act on stakeholder feedback on that roadmap
* Work in the open, with fully open-source code[^1]

## Metrics

The following metrics serve as key performance indicators of whether we're achieving our mission as described above.
