          Create a replica of AWS PROD database for legacy grants.gov in a beta.grants.gov environment. Replica should (1) journal all changes from legacy DB to new system DB and (2) support uptime even while legacy DB is undergoing planned or unplanned downtime, maintenance, and upgrades.

          The creation of this replica should be scripted using infrastructure as code.

          Create a script or other automated tool that:

          1. Generates a database matching the schema of the beta.grants.gov core replica DB.
          2. Generates consistent fake example data that can be used for testing. (e.g., using the same random seed to generate consistent data, or saving test data values somewhere accessible)

          This will dramatically speed up development because it will allow any developer to generate a local copy of the database that acts the same as the PROD beta.grants.gov database in their environment.

          By having consistent test data, we can create integration tests that look for expected and unexpected behaviors.

          Ideally, fields would be defined only once in the codebase, and these definitions would be used to generate (with as little manual configuration as possible) both RESTful API endpoints and the documentation for those endpoints.

          Otherwise, every time there is a change in schema, it requires a lot of developer attention to update field definitions, API definitions, and API documentation.

          This API should be accessible even when legacy grants.gov is experiencing planned or unplanned outages.

          Metrics:
          * Number of unique users accessing API
          * Number of total API calls made

          Based on the plan defined in `DB-API-Plan`, choose and implement a framework for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

          When commits are made to any branch, these should automatically:
          * Run lint suite
          * Run test suite
          * Deploy branch to backend and/or frontend test environments

          When commits are made to `staging` branch, these should automatically:
          * Deploy branch to STAGING environments
          * Run smoke tests and integration tests in STAGING

          When merges are made to `main`, these should automatically:
          * Deploy branch to PROD environments
          * Run smoke tests and integration tests in PROD

          Metrics:
          * Frequency of deploys to production
          * Duration of time it takes per deploy
          * Duration of time it takes per rollback

          For discussion: is a STAGING environment and `staging` branch necessary at this stage, or should we continuously deploy to PROD as feature branches are merged into `main`?

          Ideally, we would like to ensure a certain percentage of our ongoing sprint velocity (at least 20-30% at the beginning?) is devoted to improving our developer tools (i.e., autoformatters, build tools, etc) and communication tools (i.e., our wiki, milestones docs, etc). By investing in speeding up team productivity, we will drastically increase the speed of our delivery.

          We should track the percentage of story points devoted to improving team efficiency and joy and ensure that they're hitting at least our target percentage each sprint.

          Based on the plan defined in `API-Docs-Plan`, launch a publicly accessible page for developer tooling and API documentation, such as https://beta.grants.gov/developers. For reference, see examples such as the one at https://qpp.cms.gov/developers.

          This could be a microsite hosted on its own, or deployed within and as part of the beta.grants.gov integrated front-end experience.

          This should include full OpenAPI documentation of the `GET Opportunities` API, as well as a tutorial for users who are interacting with the `beta.grants.gov` APIs for the first time.

          The documentation should also describe what is likely to be stable in the API as it is developed versus what is unstable and will likely change without warning.

          The update and deployment of documentation should be fully open source and managed through infrastructure as code.

          Configure web analytics in documentation to track visitors.

          Metrics:

          * Number of unique monthly average users of API documentation
          * Number of repeat users of API documentation
          * Feedback survey results on usability of API documentation?

          The definition of this milestone could change based on planning done in `DB-API-Plan`.

          Metrics:
          * Number of unique users receiving webhooks calls
          * Number of total webhooks calls received

        description: |
          For the front-end, there is a great tool (https://backyourstack.com/) that shows fundraising being conducted by the packages that are used as dependencies in your project. This tool currently only supports fundraising done through OpenCollective, which provides a systematic API that can be used to collect this data.

          This milestone is to add to that tool support for backend packages such as Python that are raising funds through OpenCollective.

          Based on initial research, the level of effort should be assessed to determine whether the time it would take to implement this milestone is worth the result. If it's longer than 2 weeks time of one developer, it may not be worth it.

        description: |
          Investigate whether it is appropriate to develop a protocol that is system-agnostic that describes the core components of what's contained in an opportunity. This could be shared across both federal grantmaking as well as some private-sector grantmaking to facilitate standardization and simplification. This could help bring us closer to the goal of having, for grantmaking, a version of what US colleges and universities share in their [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/).

          The protocol would be implemented by our particular API ecosystem, but other platforms could implement the same protocol as well.

          Much more investigation is needed to define this milestone.

          Setup ongoing meetings that are necessary for delivery across all teams working on grants.gov and NOFO simplification.

          These meetings will help us align with a two-week sprint cycle. As much as possible, meetings will be open to members of the open source community and general public.

          Where possible and appropriate, it would be great to use 'unconference' tooling (the CEJST team used GitHub issues, but this had a challenging user experience) so that any participant can propose a topic for discussion for either themselves or others to facilitate. On the CEJST team, the team would propose a topic subject, description, duration, and facilitator name. For instance, here's an example entry:

              Subject: Review latest user research findings
              Description: We just completed two weeks of our latest user research study and want to review the findings and answer questions for anyone interested
              Duration: 30 minutes
              Facilitator: Abdul

          Ideally these topics would have updates as well to let participants indicate which presentations they're most interested in seeing.

          As of this time, it probably makes most sense to have all these meetings online, or at least in a hybrid online/in-person format.

          These should be discussed and refined, and we're open to all ideas about how to make this more effective, but here's an example set of meetings:

          1. Team of teams: sprint planning (60m, once per 2 weeks)
            - Review delivery plan for each team for the coming 2 week sprint
            - This meeting is at the start of the sprint.
          2. Team of teams: burndown check-in (30m, once per 2 weeks)
            - Mid-sprint review of burndown charts against delivery.
            - This meeting is in the middle of the sprint.
          3. Demo of demos (60m, once per 2 weeks)
            - All teams present demos of what was delivered this sprint.
          4. Retro (60m, once per 2 weeks)
            - Retrospective on what went well, what could go better, review and agree upon specific ideas for improvements
            - Using a tool such as EasyRetro
            - At the end of the agenda, each person self-reports how happy they are with their work and the project right now, and what could be done to make them happier.
          5. Open discussion calendar holds (60m, once per two weeks)
            - Calendar hold to keep time on everyone's calendar for whatever ad-hoc topics are needed.
            - Use unconference tooling
          6. Milestone pre-planning (15m, as needed)
            - One meeting per milestone definition
            - Do a quick overview of milestones that are getting ready to be defined
          7. Milestone planning (60m, as needed)
            - One meeting per milestone definition
            - Present near-final draft of milestone definition, according to milestone template.
            - Review and get feedback from all attendees, answer all outstanding questions
            - Mark milestone as fully defined and ready to be worked.
          8. Grants.gov tea time (60m, once per two weeks)
            - A casual social hang to get to know each other better as people outside of just our daily work.
            - Host this during a casual part of the sprint cycle (not the beginning or end).
          9. Open source community gathering (60m, once per two weeks)
            - A gathering of members of the public specifically to talk about issues relevant to the open source nature of the project.

          To organize the delivery of this milestone, it may be useful to create a ticket for each of the meetings underneath the overall milestone epic.

          For each of these meetings, their definition of done is:

          * Meeting invites sent
          * Method for easily adding people to the invites is documented publicly
          * Recurring agenda set (in our shared comms tools (e.g., our Wiki) and in body of the calendar invite)
          * Roles are set (e.g., an MC or rotating MC schedule is assigned)
          * We've had at least one of these meetings

          For the hackathon, we may choose to form workgroups that function as a sort of caucus that makes recommendations about various entries. This paradigm can be continued as part of the ongoing open source work on grants.gov.

          Workgroups review demos and make recommendations and endorsements representing their affinity group.

          For instance, there could be different workgroups for:

          * Staff from city governments
          * Environmental justice / Justice40 organizations
          * Grantmaking networks (such as Grant Professionals Association)
          * Visually impaired individuals and/or individuals with other accessibility needs
          * System-to-system users

          Grants.gov team staff would provide support through tools to assist these groups in decisionmaking and submitting recommendations. As with all members of the public, they'd be invited to attend sprint demos and other planning sessions.

          For this milestone, we would recruit at least three participants for each of three workgroups to help get the concept started.

        description: |
          Implement a process (preferably an automated one) that makes translations quickly and accurately available for content.

          This could include using the State Department for translation like many USDS websites do, or setting up external bounties for translation such as those used by Open Collective Foundation: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/contributing/translation#bounties.

          Preference for integrating the external team that does translations directly into the codebase so they can make their own pull requests to content.

          Define languages planned on support for website. The most common languages are published by the Census: https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/languages-we-speak-in-united-states.html. A reasonable option for a starting point for supported languages would be Spanish and either Mandarin or Cantonese (the Census marks both of these as 'Chinese' so it is not clear which is the 3rd most commonly spoken language in the US).

          For language data, there is more detailed microdata found in the Microdata Access Tool (MDAT).  Here's a table using the 2021 1-year ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) file: https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS1Y2021&rv=HHLANP&wt=WGTP.

          Ideally, every release of new content should be followed shortly thereafter by translations in key supported languages. Milestones will not be complete until their related content is released in all supported languages.

          Organizations are located in and/or serving very specific geographies. Currently, there's no way to add geographic search filters to results. For instance, searching "environmental justice" returns a lot of results for international aid or for specific countries (e.g., Mexico) that will be irrelevant to applicants from Alabama.

          Build a search API feature that, for at least some NOFOs, restricts search results to the geographies that are affiliated with the applicant that is searching for NOFOs.

          The challenge with this milestone will be that few NOFOs have easily accessible, clearly tagged geographic data. Perhaps we can setup a system of adding this data per NOFO, or crowdsourcing the data with verification.

          Since January 25, 2023, Huge has conducted in-depth one-on-one interviews with applicants and grantors to understand the end user experience of Grants.gov. With the aim of creating a more equitable Grants.gov, Huge explored key barriers for underserved and first-time applicants, and identified areas for improvement along the grantor and applicant user journeys. Focusing specifically on Find and Apply functions, Huge examined the role of Grants.gov in the broader grant opportunity ecosystem and examined specific pain points that hinder the grant seeking process for end users.

          The results of these findings will be incorporated in the Phase II Vision presentation, which will feature user archetypes and a strategic vision for a more equitable Grants.gov. The purpose of this document is to serve as a topline preview of grantor and applicant insights as the Huge team continues to synthesize research findings and inform the overall vision.

          Research Objectives

          1. Exploration of the role of Grants.gov in the broader ecosystem: Examine existing user behaviors in the grant seeker's and grantor's journey, identifying where Grants.gov fits in their overall approach and what role it provides in relation to other systems.
          2. Evaluation of semi-structured Grants.gov experience: Investigate participants' experience, including their organic user journeys based on their role, features of Grants.gov that standout, and any challenges they have with the interaction along the way.
          3. Evaluation of specific task completion: Observe participants' pain points and delights while they attempt to complete specific journeys related to their roles in posting, finding, and applying to grants, and their ability to complete related tasks.
          4. Exploration of opportunities for an equitable experience: Identify key barriers to and areas of opportunity where grants.gov can help increase applications for underserved communities.

          Note: Research synthesis must inform all UI designs. This relationship is not always marked on the diagram due to the complexity of the arrows, but it is a necessary dependency for all UI designs.

          Deliverables from Huge:

          * Research synthesis - Huge will compile findings from the user research sessions to identify key insights. In doing this, we will highlight user pain points and challenges as well as features and functionalities that are liked by users today.
          * Archetype definition - Based on research findings, Huge will define user archetypes structured by needs and behavioral attributes. These archetypes create a common, shared understanding of users’ behaviors, attitudes, goals, and pain points that will need to be met by the future state of Grants.gov.
          * UX explorations - The Huge UX lead will design initial wireframes that will explore identified areas of opportunity as a way to highlight future state solutions for Grants.gov.  Wireframes will be illustrative but will provide a solid foundation for planning and development of high fidelity design.
          * Visual design explorations - The Huge team will ideate on how to improve the current Grants.gov design system visually. Explorations will be illustrative but could be iterated on in future phases of work.
          * Vision creation - The vision for Grants.gov will summarize our recommended ‘North Star’ for the product ecosystem.  This north star will provide the guardrails for planning the subsequent design and release phases.
          * Roadmap planning - Based on the shared vision, Huge will define a sequenced roadmap for how to bring to life Grants.gov that takes into account regular, iterative releases of key functionality.

          Conduct user research on the process of grantors writing NOFO listings.

          This includes the stages of planning, budgeting, designing, developing, writing, getting approvals on content, and posting.

          Producing a user journey on this topic would be essential for developing features relating to enhanced NOFO listing pages, because we need to understand how users write and post their NOFOs.

        description: |
          A page for individual NOFO listings.

          Should likely be built using configurable page template. For instance, using query parameters (or path parameters?) users should be able to view the NOFO listing in an alternative template format. This will make it easier to try new, modified designs for improved user experiences in the future and allow customization for users. (For instance, a third party could contribute a template via open source code that can be easily configured by users who want to use that third-party template.)

          This milestone uses *only* the standard fields and data that are available for all NOFOs in the grants.gov legacy database.

        description: |
          Target launch date: Between January 2024 and March 2024

          An enhanced page for individual NOFO listings, to be launched with at least 5 real, live NOFOs by approximately March 2024.

          This listing page should have interactive contents, informed by best practices in design and user research on the topic, that make the content of the NOFOs easily accessible to users. The content should have a better user experience than simply a link to a PDF.

          In planning this milestone, it's useful to know that most HHS OpDivs develop and submit NOFOs through GrantSolutions, using templates within GrantSolutions. GrantSolutions also provides a structured review process that facilitates getting several rounds of review of the NOFO listing and approvals from various departments (legal, budget, etc) before any content is approved as final. When the final approvals are in and the user chooses to submit the NOFO listing, GrantSolutions then posts the content over system-to-system connections to grants.gov.

          One challenge of this milestone is that unlike its dependency, `NOFO-Listing-UI`, it may require using specialized content that is not available through the legacy grants.gov databases. This may require setting up a new service or API that allows this new content to be submitted. This may require updating GrantSolutions and its accompanying workflows to support that new content.

          Alternatively, the content management for new NOFO listings may be as simple as configuring a headless CMS to support permissioning and approvals by the program staff. More user research is necessary to understand the journey map of NOFO writers and ensure that this enhanced NOFO listing milestone has all of its dependencies known.

          Definition of done:
          * For five or more NOFOs, program staff writing the NOFOs are able to submit the listing's content through an automated service of some kind that then populates the data onto beta.grants.gov.
          * For five or more NOFOs, those listings are available in production at beta.grants.gov with an enhanced page listing experience for real programs.
