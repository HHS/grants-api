# Grants.gov: Milestones plan for March 2024

## Overview

In order to plan appropriately and organize our efforts, it is helpful to have a broad plan that covers our goals for the coming months, through March 2024.

As much as possible, this work should be delivered iteratively so that the work is delivered early and often, and not saved for a 'big bang' delivery near the end of the time period.

In order to reduce redundant information, this document only refers to milestones using their "short names". These can be searched in both the [milestone short descriptions file](./milestone_short_descriptions.md) and the [dependency diagram](./milestone_dependency_diagram.mmd).

*Note: there is probably a better format / location for saving this plan, but for now I'm getting started in this directory and file. Other suggestions on location are extremely welcome.*

## North star milestones

The following milestones are considered essential to finish before March 2024. They serve as "north star" milestones because they provide clear, simple goals of delivering value to our users and stakeholders. At the same time, they require many dependencies to be completed in order for them to be completed, so they help organize the rest of the work on the platform.

* Open-Source-Group
* Hackathon-Listing
* GET-Opportunities
* Foundational-UI
* Search-UI
* NOFO-Listing-UI-Enhanced
* Measurement-Dashboard

## Additional milestones

These milestones should also be delivered by March 2024, but are not considered 'north star' milestones in the sense meant above.

* Unified-Brand
* User-Research-NOFO-Writing
* User-Research-Incentives
* i18n

## Milestone subgraphs

Many subgraphs are related to the milestones above. These are the groupings labeled in the [dependency diagram](./milestone_dependency_diagram.mmd) as subgraphs. For instance, the top left of the dependency diagram currently has a yellow/beige box labeled "Communications Tooling." That is the "Communications Tooling" subgraph, and all the milestones inside that box are considered part of that subgraph.

For the next six months, in order to successfully complete the milestones above in accordance with the quality standards of this project, it would be important to finish most, if not all of, the milestones within the following subgraphs:

* Communications Tooling
* User interface
* Initial API deployment

## Stretch goals
* AuthN-API
