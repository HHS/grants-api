## Short description
<!-- Required -->

Launch a minimum viable search feature for Simpler Grants.gov that allows non-technical users to filter funding opportunities by *at least* one field and/or by keywords.

## Goals

### Business description & value
<!-- Required -->

The launch of a basic search feature primarily proves our ability to integrate front-end and backend systems in a production environment, while also providing a minimum viable product (MVP) that we can leverage for targeted user testing.

As a result, this deliverable aims to:

- Successfully integrate the front-end with the API for the first time in production
- Create the internal infrastructure needed to support future search functionality
- Establish simpler.grants.gov as the location where that functionality will be released
- Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that we can use to collect user feedback from a targeted set of stakeholders

By contrast, this MVP version of search ***does not*** attempt to:

- Replicate *all* of the search functionality currently supported by grants.gov
- Dramatically improve the accuracy of search results relative to those returned by grants.gov
- Replace grants.gov as the primary platform applicants use to find funding opportunities

### User Stories
<!-- Required -->

- As a **{type of user 1}**, I want to:
  - {perform action 1}, so that {goal or motivation for action}
  - {perform action 2}, so that {goal or motivation for action}
- As a **{type of user 2}**, I want to:
  - {perform action 1}, so that {goal or motivation for action}
  - {perform action 2}, so that {goal or motivation for action}
