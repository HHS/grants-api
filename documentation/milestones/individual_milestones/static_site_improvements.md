## Short description
<!-- Required -->

**What:** Update the static site to include additional functionality and infrastructure that was excluded from the launch, such as content management, translations, and feedback mechanisms.

**Why:** Reinforces the agile approach we're taking and improves the infrastructure that supports long-term site maintenance.

**Who:** The functionality included in this deliverable has two primary audiences:
- Stakeholders who speak a language other than English
- Internal stakeholders and project maintainers

## Goals

### Business description & value
<!-- Required -->

By delivering the next batch of updates to the static site, this body of work aims to:

- Reinforce the iterative approach we're taking with product improvements and releases
- Continue to build critical infrastructure to support:
  - Enabling internal, non-technical stakeholders to more easily make content changes
  - Translating content into multiple languages
  - Collecting feedback from site visitors

### User Stories
<!-- Required -->

- As a **project maintainer**, I want:
  - a streamlined way to manage site content, so that minor copy edits aren't blocked by (or detract from) engineering capacity
  - a mechanism to collect and store feedback from site visitors, so that we can solicit user input and questions throughout the project
- As an **stakeholder whose primary language is not English**, I want:
  - the site contents to be translated into my primary language, so that I can understand how to use the simple.grants.gov without relying on automatic translations
  - to be able to easily toggle between the supported languages from an easy to locate portion of the site, so that I don't have to spend a lot of time searching for that functionality in my non-dominant language
