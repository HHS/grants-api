## Goals

### Business description & value

This milestone aims to establish regular and well-coordinated meetings among teams working on grants.gov and the NOFO simplification. The meetings chosen will facilitate effective delivery, enabling teams to review plans, track progress, showcase demos, and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, by including the open source community and the general public, the meetings promote transparency and collaboration, harnessing broader perspectives and fostering engagement. Conducting the meetings online or in a hybrid format ensures accessibility and flexibilitiy. The milestone works to enhance communication, coordination, and collaboration. 

### User stories

- As a **full-time HHS staff member**, I want to:
  - to have well-organized and recurring meeting to ensure effective coordination and alignment among teams working on grants.gov and NOFO simiplification
  -  the meeting meeting invites to be sent promptly and include all relevant stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is informed and can actively participate.
  -  to have a transparent and accessible method for adding people to meeting invites, making it easy to include new team members and external contributors.
- As a **member of an HHS contractor team**, I want to:
  -  to be part of the recurring meetings to stay informed and continue to contribute to the progress, plans, and delivery related to grants.gov and NOFO simplification.
  -  receive meeting invites in a timely manner, ensuring that I can contribute effectively to discussions and decision-making processes.
- As a **member of the public**, I want to:
  -  I want to participate in meetings that discuss issues relevant to the open-source nature of the project, allowing me to contribute my insights and suggestions.
  -   I want to have the opportunity to propose and discuss relevant topics using the unconference-style tooling, fostering collaboration and sharing expertise.
  -   I want the meetings to be inclusive and open to diverse perspectives, fostering collaboration and leveraging the collective wisdom of the community.

### Technical description

Setup ongoing meetings that are necessary for delivery across all teams working on grants.gov and NOFO simplification.

These meetings will help us align with a two-week sprint cycle. As much as possible, meetings will be open to members of the open source community and general public.

Where possible and appropriate, it would be great to use 'unconference' tooling (the CEJST team used GitHub issues, but this had a challenging user experience) so that any participant can propose a topic for discussion for either themselves or others to facilitate. On the CEJST team, the team would propose a topic subject, description, duration, and facilitator name. For instance, here's an example entry:

  Subject: Review latest user research findings
    Description: We just completed two weeks of our latest user research study and want to review the findings and answer questions for anyone interested
    Duration: 30 minutes
    Facilitator: Abdul

Ideally these topics would have updates as well to let participants indicate which presentations they're most interested in seeing.

As of this time, it probably makes most sense to have all these meetings online, or at least in a hybrid online/in-person format.

Below is an example set of meetings. These are just an example set and part of this milestone is to determine which meetings are relevant for the teams, grants.gov and NOFO simplification: 

1. Team of teams: sprint planning (60m, once per 2 weeks)
  - Review delivery plan for each team for the coming 2 week sprint
  - This meeting is at the start of the sprint.
2. Team of teams: burndown check-in (30m, once per 2 weeks)
  - Mid-sprint review of burndown charts against delivery.
  - This meeting is in the middle of the sprint.
3. Demo of demos (60m, once per 2 weeks)
  - All teams present demos of what was delivered this sprint.
4. Retro (60m, once per 2 weeks)
  - Retrospective on what went well, what could go better, review and agree upon specific ideas for improvements
  - Using a tool such as EasyRetro
  - At the end of the agenda, each person self-reports how happy they are with their work and the project right now, and what could be done to make them happier.
5. Open discussion calendar holds (60m, once per two weeks)
  - Calendar hold to keep time on everyone's calendar for whatever ad-hoc topics are needed.
  - Use unconference tooling
6. Milestone pre-planning (15m, as needed)
  - One meeting per milestone definition
  - Do a quick overview of milestones that are getting ready to be defined
7. Milestone planning (60m, as needed)
  - One meeting per milestone definition
  - Present near-final draft of milestone definition, according to milestone template.
  - Review and get feedback from all attendees, answer all outstanding questions
  - Mark milestone as fully defined and ready to be worked.
8. Grants.gov tea time (60m, once per two weeks)
  - A casual social hang to get to know each other better as people outside of just our daily work.
  - Host this during a casual part of the sprint cycle (not the beginning or end).
9. Open source community gathering (60m, once per two weeks)
  - A gathering of members of the public specifically to talk about issues relevant to the open source nature of the project.

To organize the delivery of this milestone, it may be useful to create a ticket for each of the meetings underneath the overall milestone epic.

### Definition of done

For each of these meetings, their definition of done is:

- [ ] List of all recurring meeting schedule established: Determine necessary meetings that need to take place for effective delivery across all teams - grants.gov and NOFO simplification. 
- [ ] Meeting invites sent
- [ ] Method for easily adding people to the invites is documented publicly making it easy for the public to join relevant meetings
- [ ] Meeting agendas defined: prepare clear agendas for each recurring meeting, outlining the topics to be discussed and desired outcomes. 
- [ ] Roles are set (facilitators, rotating MC, etc) 
- [ ] Team norming: Plan to gather feedback from meeting participants to assess the effectiveness and value of the recurring meetings
- [ ] We've had at least one of these meetings

### Proposed metrics for measuring goals/value/definition of done

- Meeting attendance: measure the number of participants attending each meeting to ensure sufficient representation from relevant teams and stakeholders
- Meeting effectiveness and retrospective feedback: gather feedback in retros or another avenue to etermine if the meetings scheduled are effective, meet intended objectives, identify areas for improvement, and address pain points.
- Long-term sustainability: monitory the continuity of recurring meetings to ensure that they are consistently scheduled and attended. Determine if there meeting cadence or frequency is appropriate for the team to balance between meeting commitments and their ability to effectively manage their workload.
