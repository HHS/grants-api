# Front-end Planning

## Short description

Choose language (e.g., TypeScript), framework (e.g., React) and testing framework (e.g., Jest) for front-end.


## Goals

The goal of the front-end planning milestone is to evaluate the most suitable front-end technologies and frameworks, including programming language, front-end framework, and testing framework. By making informed decisions during this phase, we aim to establish a solid foundation for front-end development that promotes efficient, scalable, and high-quality code with aligning with project requirements and maximize developer productivity.
