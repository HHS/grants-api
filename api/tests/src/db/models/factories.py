"""Factories for generating test data.

These factories are used to generate test data for the tests. They are
used both for generating in memory objects and for generating objects
that are persisted to the database.

The factories are based on the `factory_boy` library. See
https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for more information.
