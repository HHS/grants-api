There is another ticket for this.\r\n\r\nThere are several components.\r\n\r\n### Replication\r\n\r\nWe will need to get updated data from the existing grants.gov database. We will likely use the AWS DMS tool for this.\r\n\r\nQuestions include whether we would pull in all of the data updates or only specific tables.\r\n\r\nReplication would require that journaling is turned on on the existing Oracle database, and would affect that resource utilization of that database.\r\n\r\n### Transformation\r\n\r\nWe will undoubtedly need to do some kind of transformation once we have features that use the database. This may involve changing the data types of existing columns, creating new views to better support the API or aother analysis, or data cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe DMS tool supports this, however we may want to build our own transformation pipeline. A tool like dbt might be a good fit. In that case we would likely use an ELT strategy, first getting replicated data, then transforming it. The ADR could leave this decision for future work.\r\n\r\n### New Data Model\r\n\r\nOnce we start working on #70, we may want to store the data differently than in the current system. If this is the case we can describe that as changing or creating a new data model. If we change the data model then we will need to incorporate this in the transformation step.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to Test and Prod database\r\n\r\nThe spike should consider exactly what access point needs to be setup to peer between the VPCs in AWS, or if there is another connection strategy. This discovery should also note what other steps like turning on journaling will be necessary.\r\n\r\n### Questions to answer\r\n\r\n1. Do we want to replicate the database at all right now? \r\n2. Do we want to replicate the entire database or just specific tables for get_opportunities endpoint? (what is easiest is okay for us)\r\n3. What will we do for test data in our dev environment/local development?\r\n\r\n### Open Questions / Notes\r\n  - Separate this into it's own task - Local dev data strategy (use of fixture data vs connecting to dev or prod AWS envs)\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [ ] A comment in this ticket or a page in the internal wiki documenting \r\n  - [ ] Replication strategy (ie DMS, certain tables)\r\n  - [ ] Initial transformation strategy \r\n  - [ ] Description of different environments (dev / prod)\r\n- [ ] AWS budget has been updated if necessary\r\n- [ ] Steps that MH will need to take to support the decision will be recorded, such as turning on journaling or network setup\r\n- [ ] List of high level tasks that can be turned into tickets in order to start development\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\nAfter this spike, we should be able to:\r\n\r\n* Write the #322 \r\n* Create an initial epic, ie \"Setup DMS Tool and Dev Database Replication\" with a backlog of tasks\r\n* Define following epics to define replication work\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We also want to collect general responses to the new NOFO prototypes. \r\n\r\nWe're basically asking 2 questions: \r\n- What do you think of the new prototype funding announcements? \r\n- What do you think of the current funding announcements and/or grants.gov? \r\n\r\nOpen feedback should be collected through an open-ended text box (or two) that allows the user to write whatever they want. Either question can be address or ignored. \r\n\r\nWe need to decide by which method and technology we will collect this feedback. \r\n\r\n### Approvers\r\n\r\n- @lucasmbrown-usds \r\n- @itsemilyianacone\r\n- @andycochran\r\n- @sumiat \r\n- @acouch, @daphnegold, or @SammySteiner (1+ Engineer)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n- Microsoft Form (created by HHS's 365) \r\n- HTML form that posts to HHS's Sharepoint\r\n- HTML form that creates a GitHub issue, letting users know their response will create a public issue w/o needing to create a GitHub account\r\n- Create and embed an open text form with a user research tool like [Dovetail](https://dovetail.com/), so that feedback  is captured, centralized, and analyzed in the same place as future research studies\r\n- Link to (or embed) a Google form \r\n- Start a Google Group for the community, ask users to share there\r\n- ???\r\n\r\n### Decision Criteria\r\n\r\n- Should not feel like a black box for the user\r\n- Has a better UX than sending an email \r\n- The prompt is open-ended, yet guides the user to contribute meaningful and helpful feedback\r\n- Submissions are easy to sort through, analyze, and synthesize\r\n- User understands how their submission will be used\r\n- Does not require PRA clearance \r\n- Primary audience\r\n\r\nThis work should also include the use case for a Contact Us on simpler.grants.gov: \r\n\r\nExplore options for solutions that allow members of of the public to submit questions or comments about the project as an alternative to a public forum like a listserv:\r\n\r\n[Front](https://front.com/)\r\n[Loop Email](https://www.intheloop.io/pricing-us/)\r\n[Google collaborative inbox](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/167430?hl=en)\r\nContact us form on the website\r\nHHS internal options for shared inbox, such as [grants.simplification@hhs.gov](mailto:grants.simplification@hhs.gov)\r\nOthers as suggested by dev team\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [ ] The approvers for this decision have been identified (ideally before work on the ADR starts)\r\n- [ ] The ADR is created and stored in `documentation/decisions/adr` with status \"Accepted\"\r\n- [ ] The ADR has been reviewed and approved by the approvers listed above\r\n- [ ] The ADR satisfies requirements that are outlined in the ADR template\r\n- [ ] Any follow-up tickets have been created (if necessary)\r\n\r\n### Open questions / Notes\r\n- What are the use cases?

One of these platforms is a wiki for storing notes, documents, and other content about the project. Ideally we would select a platform that balances ease of use and flexibility with the cost of implementing and maintaining the wiki.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this ADR is to evaluate a series of potential wiki platforms and determine which one best fits the needs and objectives of this project based on the decision criteria outlined below. \r\n\r\nRelated to #22 \r\n\r\n### Approvers\r\n\r\n- @lucasmbrown-usds \r\n- @sarahknoppA6 \r\n- @acouch \r\n- @sumiat \r\n- @andycochran \r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n- [Confluence](confluence)\r\n- [Notion](notion)\r\n- [GitHub Wiki](gh-wiki)\r\n- [GitBook](gitbook)\r\n- [WikiJS](wiki-js)\r\n\r\n### Decision Drivers\r\n\r\n#### Must Have\r\n\r\n- **Usability:** Non-technical users should be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.\r\n- **Content Review:** Collaborators should be able to review and edit draft content before those changes are published.\r\n- **Version History:** Editors should be able to see and restore previous versions of a given page.\r\n- **Multi-Media:** The platform should support multiple types of media (e.g. videos, images, file uploads, tables, diagrams) with minimal configuration.\r\n- **Internationalization (i18n):** The platform should provide support for displaying content in multiple languages.\r\n- **Web Analytics:** The platform should provide support for tracking site usage and other web analytics.\r\n- **Onboarding Costs:** Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).\r\n- **Maintenance Costs:** It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the wiki, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).\r\n\r\n#### Nice to Have\r\n\r\n- **External Contributions:** Members of the public should be able to suggest changes to wiki content and internal stakeholders should be able to review those contributions before they are published.\r\n- **Data Access:** Content generated and stored in the wiki should be accessible outside of the wiki platform, either through syncing content to an HHS owned repository or through an official API.\r\n- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage and host the wiki content should be open source, if possible.\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [ ] The ADR is drafted and stored in documentation/[ADR folders TBD]/\r\n- [ ] The ADR is included in the necessary table of contents in the ADR/decision folder\r\n- [ ] The ADR describes the drivers and pros and cons of the decision\r\n- [ ] The ADR has been reviewed and approved by the internal team\r\n- [ ] The ADR satisfies requirements that are outlined in the ADR template",

Unfortunately, the order of the subgraphs is important because the first time a node appears in the Markdown determines the subgraph that the Node will be a part of. Given that the subgraphs are extremely complex, this makes it hard to edit the diagram and NOT have a node switch subgraphs.\r\n\r\nFor example, it might look like: \r\n\r\n``` \r\nflowchart LR\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 1 \r\n        A\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 2 \r\n        A --\u003e B\r\n    end\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhereas the same code with the subgraphs reordered:\r\n\r\n```\r\nflowchart LR\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 2 \r\n        A --\u003e B\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 1 \r\n        A\r\n    end\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWill render differently. \r\n\r\nTo solve this, I'm going to remove all links from all subgraphs, and only define the nodes in each subgraph. Then I'll define the links outside of the subgraphs. Like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nflowchart LR\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 2 \r\n        B\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    subgraph Subgraph 1 \r\n        A\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    A--\u003eB\r\n```",

In this issue, we want to perform a technical spike to identify shortcomings and must-haver requirements that will support the design of the new data model. The goal is to gather information on the problem landscape with the current DB, requirements, and use cases. The previous team has implemented several DB performance improvements which should also be considered.  \r\n\r\nThere are a few open questions that are also needed to be answered. You can find them in the [the milestone doc](https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-gov/blob/main/documentation/milestones/individual_milestones/db_planning.md#open-questions) introduced by #104 \r\n\r\n### Outcomes\r\n\r\nThe spike will provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and requirements related to the current database. It will help in scoping the DB work effectively and guide the design of a new data model that addresses identified shortcomings and aligns with stakeholder and user needs. \r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n- [ ] Spike document created that provides information to support the design of the new data model\r\nQuestions have been reviewed and answered with support of HHS staff\r\n- [ ] The answers to all of the questions have been documented in the milestone document\r\n - [ ] Will this database serve as an OLTP system, OLAP system, or both? Will this database be used for analytics, and is there a need for a second database to be created with data pipelines?\r\n - [ ] What are the current datastores that support the legacy Grants.gov system?\r\n - [ ] Is the existing Grants.gov database heavy on read or write transactions?\r\n - [ ] How many external sources does the existing database have?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- Decreased application process time by over 90%(from 2+ minutes to under 12 seconds)\r\n- Reduced query run times by an average of 90% by tuning top 25 database queries\r\n- Reduced login time by 66% (from 3 seconds to under 1 second)\r\n- Reduced time to extract information from the SAM directory by 96.5%(from over 22 hours each month to under 45 minutes)\r\n- Moved 60% of database cron jobs to scheduler jobs, improving monitoring and success rates\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "### Description \r\nThis ADR is to assess the necessity and feasibility of implementing a Content Management System (CMS) for our project. It aims to evaluate the pros and cons, and to help answer whether implementing a CMS is critical at this stage or if it can be deferred, identify the content that requires updates, quantify the volume of content, and establish use cases and user stories to guide our decision.\r\n\r\n### Approvers\r\n-  1 engineer not on the ticket\r\n- @widal001 and/or @lucasmbrown-usds \r\n\r\n\r\n### Decision Criteria\r\nDecision criteria that could potentially impact the decision:\r\n\r\n- **Content volume and complexity**: volume of content that needs to be managed and its complexity. **Rationale**: A headless CMS might be more valuable when dealing with large volumes of content, etc. \r\n- **Content update frequency**: assess how frequently the content needs to be updated or revised. Determine whether multiple teams members or content creators will be involved in content updates. **Rationale**: If the project requires frequent content updates, collab amongst team members (NOFO transformation team, etc.), a content approval workflow then a headless CMS could streamline these processes. \r\n- **Scalability and growth**: Consider the scalability of your project and potential future growth. Evaluate whether your project's content and features will expand over time. **Rationale**: A headless CMS could offer flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for projects with evolving content and functionality.\r\n- **Implementation and level of effort**: evaluate if there is an urgency with implementing a CMS now versus later in the project and whether there is an option for a phased implementation. **Rationale**: setting up a CMS may introduce a high initial set up phase and this could impact other priorities on the project. \r\n\r\nOpen question: \r\n- Integration and extensibility: assess the need to integrate the project with external systems, third-party tools, or custom apps. **Rationale**: CMS might be helpful when integrating with other systems. \r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [ ] If the outcome of this ADR is that we are moving forward with a CMS system in the near-term, add an ADR ticket to evaluate CMS options. \r\n- [ ]  The approvers for this decision have been identified (ideally before work on the ADR starts)\r\n- [ ]  The ADR is created and stored in documentation/decisions/adr with status \"Accepted\"\r\n- [ ]  The ADR has been reviewed and approved by the approvers listed above\r\n- [ ]  The ADR satisfies requirements that are outlined in the ADR template\r\n- [ ]  Any follow-up tickets have been created (if necessary)",
